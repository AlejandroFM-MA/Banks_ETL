# **Banks_ETL**

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project focuses on extracting the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization (in billion USD). The extracted data is then transformed into multiple currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, and INR) using exchange rate data from a CSV file. Finally, the processed data is stored both in a CSV file and in a database, allowing managers from different countries to query the data in their respective currencies.

âœ… Extract relevant banking data from a specified URL.  
âœ… Transform the market capitalization values into billion USD.
